### web-scraping-marathon_data


The data for the Nashville Rock-and-Roll Marathon that you worked with in Excel was scraped from the `www.runrockroll.com` race results page. Now it's **your turn** to scrape the data from the website! The number of pages of results *for each race* and the base URL that you will build out is provided below.

#### Counts of result pages (found using postman) and base urls for 4 years of Marathon and 1/2 Marathon results 

```
Number of pages of results

pgs_2016 = 154
pgs_2017 = 147
pgs_2018 = 85
pgs_2019 = 113

pgs_half_2016 = 898
pgs_half_2017 = 892
pgs_half_2018 = 598
pgs_half_2019 = 690
```  

```

Base URLs for each race results page

urlbase_2019 = 'https://www.runrocknroll.com/Events/Nashville/The-Races/Marathon/2019-Results?gender=&agegroup=&bib=&firstname=&lastname=&page='
urlbase_2018 = 'https://www.runrocknroll.com/Events/Nashville/The-Races/Marathon/2018-Results?gender=&agegroup=&bib=&firstname=&lastname=&page='

**After loading the marathon and half-marathon data to DataFrames in Python, perform EDA as usual. Think of a question that you find interesting and answer it by exploring the data. Prepare a brief (5 minutes) presentation to share what you find.**
