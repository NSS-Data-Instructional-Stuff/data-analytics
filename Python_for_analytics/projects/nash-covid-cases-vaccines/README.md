## Covid-19 Cases and Vaccinations

Nashville and the rest of the world have been dealing with a pandemic for more than a year. In this project, you will explore where in the metro area people have contracted the virus and where people are getting vaccinated. Additionally, you'll look for characteristics of areas reporting a high number of cases, and areas reporting a high vaccination rate.
