### Monthly searches on the Metro Nashville website

1. Find the dataset of Top 500 Monthly Searches on https://data.nashville.gov and download the CSV for Excel version of the data. Open the file in Excel and examine it.   
    a. Be sure to choose comma delimited when prompted.   
    b. Do not worry about any datatypes for now.   
    c. **CAUTION: Be sure to save the file as a `.xlsx` file. Otherwise you will lose any functions and other analysis you perform**

2. How many rows and columns are in the dataset? Enter your answer as text in cell `M2`.

3. Enter the text “Max queries:” in cell `M3` and enter the maximum query count in `N3` using a formula.

4. Sort the data by `column D` (Query Count).    
    a. When did the maximum query count occur?  
    b. What was the Query Text?  
    c. What do you notice about the top 5 searches?  

5. Enter the text “Year is number: “ in `M4`. Use a formula in `N4` to check the first value in the Year column (C) to see if it is a number.

6. Enter the text “Query Count is number: “ in `M5`. Use a formula in `N5` to check the first value in the Query Count column (D) to see if it is a number.

7. Enter the text “Map searches:” in `M7`.
8. Enter “Count” in cell `N6`. Below it in `N7`, use a `COUNTIF()` formula to find the number of months that “maps” appeared in the _top 500 monthly searches_ (the full dataset).
9. Enter “Sum” in cell `O6`. Below it, use a `SUMIF()` formula to give a count of the total number of times that the text “maps” was searched.
10. Enter “Average” in cell `P6`. Below it, use `AVERAGEIF()` to find the average number of times that “maps” was searched (in the months that it appeared in our dataset).
11. Finally, enter “Max” in cell `Q6`, and below it use a formula to find the maximum number of times that “maps” was searched in any month.

12. In the G column, create a formula that ranks the values in the query count column (D) in descending order. Be sure to use an absolute reference for the range of values over which you want to apply the ranking.

13. To sort the data from newest to oldest, you’ll need to get `Month` as a number. Create a lookup table for Month in columns M and N starting in row 10 with the headers and ending in row 22:  

  Month Name   |  Month Num  
   -------     | :---------:  
  January      |   1   
  February     |   2   
  March        |   3   
  April        |   4   
  May          |   5   
  June         |   6   
  July         |   7   
  August       |   8   
  September    |   9   
  October      |   10   
  November     |   11   
  December     |   12   


14. Create a header at the top of column F called “Month Num”. Use a `VLOOKUP` to match the month name in the Month column (A) to the lookup table in `M11`:`N22` in order to populate the “Month Num” in column F.

15. Select columns A through G and create a custom sort (Home --> Sort & Filter --> Custom Sort).
16. Sort by the largest to smallest Year as your first level, Month Num largest to smallest as your second value, and Query Text A-Z as your third level. Scroll through to find how many times “fairgrounds” was searched in July 2018.

17. Find which month in 2016 had the most searches for “fire”. Try to use a Custom Sort to save yourself from too much scrolling up and down.

18. Enter text (“all query counts over 100:” in `M8` and use `COUNTIF()` in `N7` to count the number of times a query was run more than 100 times in a given month.

19. Enter text (“query for codes over 100 times:”) in `M9` and use `COUNTIFS()` to find the number of times users searched for ‘codes’ more than 100 times in a given month.

20. Create a new column (G) with a header of “Volume”. Populate this column with one of 3 categories: ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, ‘High’. Low volume searches happened less than 50 times in a month, medium volume searches happened between 50 and 100 times in a month (inclusive), and high volume searches were conducted more than 100 times in a month.
