1. How many npi numbers appear in the prescriber table but not in the prescription table?

2.
    a. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Family Practice.

    b. Find the top five drugs (generic_name) prescribed by prescribers with the specialty of Cardiology.

    c. Which drugs are in the top five prescribed by Family Practice prescribers and Cardiologists? Combine what you did for parts a and b into a single query to answer this question.

3. Your goal in this question is to generate a list of the top prescribers in each of the major metropolitan areas of Tennessee.
    a. First, write a query that finds the top 5 prescribers in Nashville in terms of the total number of claims (total_claim_count) across all drugs. Report the npi, the total number of claims, and include a column showing the city.
    
    b. Now, report the same for Memphis.
    
    c. Combine your results from a and b, along with the results for Knoxville and Chattanooga.

4. Find all counties which had an above-average number of overdose deaths. Report the county name and number of overdose deaths.

5.
    a. Write a query that finds the total population of Tennessee.
    
    b. Build off of the query that you wrote in part a to write a query that returns for each county that county's name, its population, and the percentage of the total population of Tennessee that is contained in that county.
