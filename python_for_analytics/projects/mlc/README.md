# The Mechanical Licensing Collective
The [Mechanical Licensing Collective (The MLC)](https://www.themlc.com/) is a nonprofit organization designated by the U.S. Copyright Office pursuant to the historic Music Modernization Act of 2018, a law which aimed to modernize copyright-related issues for music and audio recordings due to new forms of technology such as digital streaming.

In January 2021, The MLC began administering blanket mechanical licenses to eligible streaming and download services (digital service providers or DSPs) in the United States. The MLC collects the royalties due under those licenses from the DSPs and pay songwriters, composers, lyricists, and music publishers. 

The MLC has built a publicly accessible [musical works database](https://portal.themlc.com/search), as well as a portal that creators and music publishers can use to submit and maintain their musical works data.

The MLC recieves and matches sound recording usage reporting data from digital audio services with the MLC's music works ownership data. For some works, the usage data cannot be automtaically matched with ownership data, and it must be manually matched. You have been provided a dataset of 100,000 such unmatched works.

Your objective in this project is to explore these unmatched recordings to see if you can uncover any potentially interesting or useful patterns in it.
