# Tennessee's Opioid Crisis

Opioids are a class of drugs including prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, the synthetic opioid fentanyl, and the illegal drug heroin. These drugs produce euphoria in addition to pain relief, which can lead to dependence, addiction, overdose, and death. 

In the late 1990s, opioids began to be prescribed at high rates, which led to widespread misuse and ultimately created a serious national health crisis. In 2019, more than 130 people per day died from opioid-related drug overdoses in the United States. Tennessee has been one of the hardest-hit states in the opioid epidemic, with more than 1300 overdose deaths in 2018.

In this project, you will be working with a database created from the 2017 Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File to answer the following questions:  
* Which Tennessee counties had a disproportionately high number of opioid prescriptions?
* Who are the top opioid prescibers for the state of Tennessee?
* What did the trend in overdose deaths due to opioids look like in Tennessee from 2015 to 2018?
* Is there an association between rates of opioid prescriptions and overdose deaths by county?
* Is there any association between a particular type of opioid and number of overdose deaths?

Note that some zip codes will be associated with multiple fipscounty values in the zip_fips table. To resolve this, use the fipscounty with the highest tot_ratio for each zipcode.

Feel free to include any additional data sets, but it is not a requirement.

With your group, create a 10 minute presentation addressing these questions.
