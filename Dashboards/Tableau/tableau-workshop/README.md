# tableau-workshop

The way this repository is positioned is to set up users with a variety of resources to learn outside the 2 hour workshop.  
The bookmarks house a variety of information from learning videos to blogs and other resources.

Classwork -- we will go through the Interface dashboard that is in the repo and then the tutorial that is located https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-home.htm

Another way to hone your skills is Makeover Monday, www.makeovermonday.co.uk
The current week for our workshop includes the Top 30 US Fast Food Chains -- that data is also in this repo under coursework

There are so many resources to read and learn on the topic of data visualization in general.  The Nashville Tableau User Group is a great way to build community, network, and have fun with other data 'nerds'.  

Always reach out to me if you have any questions or anything.
